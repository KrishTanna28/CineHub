check shows excellent sentiment-rating alignment. 
Great work on providing specific examples!"
```

**Benefits:**

---

### 10. **Dynamic Re-evaluation** 🔄

Points are periodically recalculated as engagement changes:

#### **Time Decay**

Decay Factor = e^(-days_since_creation / 90)
Updated Points = New Points × Decay Factor
```

- Older reviews get less weight on updates
- Prevents gaming the system
- Maintains fairness over time

**Example:**
```
Review created 45 days ago
Gets 10 new likes today
Decay: e^(-45/90) = 0.61
New engagement points: 20
Applied: 20 × 0.61 = 12 points added
```
